# Classification-with-Python

Here, we try to build various Classification models and select the best to determine whether a Loan will be Paid or Defaulted. The dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields: Loan_status, Principal	Basic, Terms, Effective_date, Due_date, Age, Education, Gender etc. We start by loading the data and looking at it. The we count the number of instances. We convert the respective dates into datetime objects for proper processing. Then we visualize the data by counting the number of paid and unpaid loans. Then we plot some columns to understand data better like what day of the week people get loans, how loan paidoff and default are distributed by age, gender and amount etc. Then we convert categorical values to numerical using One-Hot Encoding and perform some more Exploratory Data Analysis on features like Education. Then we select the features and create the feature set. Then we normalize the feature set and build our respective models. Finally, we evaluate the model using Jaccard Score AND F1-Score on the Test data.
